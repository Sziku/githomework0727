Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system that is widely used for software development and other version control tasks. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed in 2005 by Linux kernel developers (including Linus Torvalds) for Linux kernel development.

Version control systems are basically a way of storing information about changes in code. They keep track of every modification to the code, including the person responsible for it and precise time.
